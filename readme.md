## Recyclable or Non-recyclable - A Classifier

 This is a retrained image recognition network that can differentiate recyclable objects from non-recyclable ones.




## The Algorithm

Using the Jetson Nano, I retrained resnet18 with a dataset I found on the Kaggle site that determined the recyclability of objects. I compiled the dataset into three folders: test, train, and val. After undergoing 34 epochs of training, it is able to categorise images of items as either recyclable ("classification 1') or non-recyclable (other) with decent accuracy.
